# Deployment Prep for ADU
---
model: gemini-2.0-flash
---
Prepare the ADU project for deployment on GitHub Pages.

Project Files:
@adu/**/*.html

Checks:
1. Verify all external resources (Google Fonts) are correctly linked.
2. Check for any hardcoded paths that might break on subdirectories.
3. Generate a `CNAME` file if needed (optional).

Current directory structure:
!`ls -R adu`

Suggest a `README.md` file for the project to explain how to use it.
